# Dependent type theory for dummies

This project offers a discussion of SimplyTyped Lambda Calculus
and Dependent Type Theory that does not require a profound
mathematical background.

The theory is introduced constructively from ground up,
without the use of set theory variants or categories.

It also contains remarks linking theoretical concepts
to actual coding patterns.
